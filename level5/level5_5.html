    <div class="body">
        <span class="one">The gently rustling leaves sound like an ocean bay
        calmly splashing against the cool wet sand.
        The lake ripples with the colors of gray and silver.
        The sky of ominous clouds is darker than gray,
        with sunshine holes beaming
        out of the corners of the sky.<br><br></span>

        <span class="two">The not-too-distant sounds of cars
        are mixed with the shaking of pine needles
        and the soft chirping of birds.
        As the afternoon grows dimmer, the crickets
        sing their cheerful songs of fall.<br><br></span>
        
        <span class="three">Across the lake the frosted tops of blue mountains
        are slowly becoming shadowed by the overlapping clouds.
        The colors of fall are swirling in the wind
        while the seagulls are crouched low upon
        the long waving blades of grass.<br><br></span>
        
        <span class="four">The cool rushing wind is racing itself
        through the sky, sending
        shivers to the people in its way.
        Fall is happening everywhere
        on this beautiful autumn day. </span>
