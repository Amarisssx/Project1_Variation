        <h1>&nbsp; An Autumn Day</h1>
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BY Lana Del Rey</h3>
        
        

        

    <div id="para">
    The gently rustling leaves sound like an ocean bay<br>
    calmly splashing against the cool wet sand.<br>
    The lake ripples with the colors of gray and silver.<br>
    The sky of ominous clouds is darker than gray,<br>
    with sunshine holes beaming<br>
    out of the corners of the sky.<br>
    The not-too-distant sounds of cars<br>
    are mixed with the shaking of pine needles<br>
    and the soft chirping of birds.<br>
    As the afternoon grows dimmer, the crickets<br>
    sing their cheerful songs of fall.<br>
    Across the lake the frosted tops of blue mountains<br>
    are slowly becoming shadowed by the overlapping clouds.<br>
    The colors of fall are swirling in the wind<br>
    while the seagulls are crouched low upon<br>
    the long waving blades of grass.<br>
    The cool rushing wind is racing itself<br>
    through the sky, sending<br>
    shivers to the people in its way.<br>
    Fall is happening everywhere<br>
    on this beautiful autumn day. <br>
